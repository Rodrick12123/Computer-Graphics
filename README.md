This project includes several .c files, each of which build upon one another, with the lowest values of 040 denoting 
the earliest files and the 740 files containing the most complex code. All files work together to do computer 
graphic-related tasks, such as images with shadows, lighting, 3D/2D views, and camera positioning.
